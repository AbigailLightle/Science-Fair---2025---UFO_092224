It fell as if falling from an invisible opening in the sky... the night was a crystal clear night sky  so no clouds or precipitation to obstruct our view and the object was closer than any I have ever witnessed before. The way the object fell was too slow to be a meteor or falling star, also noting that there was no “light trail” following behind the object as it fell. We watched it fall for about 5 seconds before it disappeared into the dark night sky somewhere close to the earth surface.  It was the strangest light; object; ufo...

The object was extremely far away, but we were able to see every color.  At one point a plane flew under the object and we were able to see how large it was in comparison.  It was at least two or three times the size of the aircraft.  The object ended up hovering for over an hour that we saw.  At one point the object dipped down and we noticed a smaller object below it that was similar.  When the larger object reached the smaller one, all of the sudden the smaller object disappeared.  We then noticed a large plane that flew under the large object flying North. The large object then suddenly disappeared. Please understand that I have never believed in UFO's nor do I believe in conspiracy theories.  This is a true account of what we have seen. I was not alone in seeing this object.  I do have a recording but my camera is so bad that it is difficult to see any of the colors that we saw on the recording.  Also, the object seemed much smaller in the recording than in real life.  If you would like for me to send you an attachment I will be more than happy to provide the documentation.  If there is an explanation for what was seen, please let me know. Thank you!

On or about July 1973 or 1974. Myself and my mother her sister and daughter was watching tv waiting for the news to come on, at 2200 hrs watching wffa channel 8 news the reporter said, ""Folks, if you want to see something amazing go out side and look over the Dallas skyline"" which we did as well as most of the block. What we all saw was three objects looked like the size of a golf balls from about 9 miles from Dallas texas looking east.  At about a 1000 to 1500 feet above Dallas.  These objects was stationery each emitting different colors like blue gold red green silver.  It was rather superb looking.  After just standing there for about a minute each one started to do bizzar monuvers like one was zigzaging the other one was going up then down zipping from on side of the sky back and forth with the other two, at on point they formed a close circle and went spinning around at very fast speed. This lasted for about 3 min.  When the US Navy put a halt to the airshow as they scrambled two F-8 crusaders which at that time was hot alert aircraft, which ment they was armed with the sidewinder missile, along with the 50.cal guns.  They flew from NAS Hensley field out side of Dallas on the southwest just about 6 miles away, it only took about 20 seconds from the time they took off to get  over Dallas.  (I seen them as they left the air station only 3 miles away) never will forget how loud they was in full afterburner,  Just before they got on station, the three objects shot straight up in the night sky in a split second.  The F-8s made a few passes over Dallas before returning to there base. This left me with a impression that the ufos wanted to show the people what they could do, I know aircraft and it was nothing  that any aircraft or helicopter could do. Not only did my family see this but was reported by was channel 8 news along with hundreds of people I will say on thing this report is not a hoax I seen other sightings as well but none as this one.",2019-04-25T00:00:00,32.835168077433146,-96.80811785917246
